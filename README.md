# Kat's Portfolio Website

This is how I am displaying my projects through my domain datalore.digital
This is a work in progress. I am planning to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to emulate a classic Windows 98 desktop. I will create navigation links using the desktop icons, some of which will link to my social media accounts, others will open pop-up menus. The menus will link to my projects on other parts of the site which I am also in the process of setting up. I will also have a section describing myself. As of right now this readme is mostly for me to visualise what I'm doing and I will update it as needed.

## How It Works

In my choose your own adventure video game [The Girl Who Learned to Code](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/LtCommData/video_game_project/) I used the CSS display property to show the next part of the story conditionally upon which button was pressed. I plan to use the same property to display the pop-up menu based on which icon is selected.
